There are times when you don't choose your friends - circumstances find them for you. Some of those friends could have bad influence on you, but it seems like they truly do care about you. At the end of the day, they are one of the very few people on this planet who can acknowledge your existence, aren't they?</p>\n<p>We are most vulnerable when we feel alone, but we should still remain mindful - I am in the hall full of people but yet the room feels really empty to me.</p>\n<section style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img alt=\"Image of two best dog friends.\" src=\"https://www.lifewithdogs.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.16.15-New-Study-Shows-Dogs-Give-Treats-to-Their-Friends3.jpg\" />\n</section>","frontmatter":{"title":"Acknowledge Someone’s Existence","date":"June 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/acknowledge-existence/"}}}
