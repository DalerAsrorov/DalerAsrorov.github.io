This is the first somewhat serious web application that I wrote in React. It took me a little while to come up with the app name. "Compono" in [Latin means arrange, compile, organize, or compose](https://www.wordsense.eu/compono/) while the ending "fy" is oftentimes attached to applications that use Spotify APIs. The name fits the purpose of the app - help Spotify users combine songs from different playlists and then either create a new playlist, or merge these songs with the existing playlist. It's kind of like combining playlists together, except that it's not necessary to add all songs from a specific playlist.
