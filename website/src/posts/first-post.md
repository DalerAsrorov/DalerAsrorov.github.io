I have been contemplating on creating a personal website that could document my work in various fields and findings. I will be writing about all kinds of stuff - coding, mental health, new research findings, my side projects, and much more. In addition, I will use this as a way to learn more about Gatsby, share my thoughts, and hopefully attract more people
to my work in the future. Thank you for reading it!

I will be writing a lot more soon but we will see how it goes.
