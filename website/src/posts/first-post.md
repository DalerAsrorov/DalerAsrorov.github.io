I have been contemplating on creating a personal website that could document my work in various fields since college graduation. I will be writing about all kinds of stuff - coding, infrastructure, personal experiences that could help you too, and my side projects. Furthermore, I will be using this site as another way to learn more about web development and Gatsby blogging engine, and to showcase my work to public that may be interested.

I will be sharing and writing a lot more soon - happy to start this journey with you!
