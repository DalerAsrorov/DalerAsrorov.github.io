Have you ever had that wholesome feeling of belonging when someone you haven’t talked to in a long while asks about your well being and seems genuinely interested about your life? Some people never had that feeling and may never experience it in their lives, ever.

Some people may feel like they barely exist. Every day. Waking up, being aware of the fact that nobody cares about you. It is a hard part of reality to swallow - your mere existence is arbitrary and most of it depends on things you don’t even have any control of - your parents, genetics, environment, friends... Yes, even friends. There are times when you cannot choose your friends - circumstances find them for you. There are friends who have bad influence on you, but at least they care about you, right? At least it feels like they are one of the very few people on this planet who can acknowledge your existence.
