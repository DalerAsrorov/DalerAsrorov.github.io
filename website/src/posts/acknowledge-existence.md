Have you ever had that wholesome feeling of belonging when someone you haven’t talked to in a long while asks about your well being and seems genuinely interested about your life? Some people never had that experience and may never experience it in their lives, ever.

Some people believe they barely exist. Every day. Waking up, not receiving a single message from their friends or family. Another great day to be convinced that no one cares. It is a hard part of reality to swallow - your mere existence is arbitrary and most of it depends on things you don’t even have any control of - your parents, genetics, environment, friends... Yes, even friends. There are times when you cannot choose your friends - circumstances find them for you. There are friends who have bad influence on you, but it seems like they do care about you. At the end of the day, they are one of the very few people on this planet who can acknowledge your existence, aren't they?

We are most vulnerable when we feel alone, but we should still remain mindful - I am in the hall full of people but yet the room feels really empty to me.
